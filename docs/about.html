  <p>
    Hello! My name is Eric Soto-Hall and I have always loved things with wheels.
    From trains to bicycles, to cars, to motorcycles — that fascination eventually
    expanded into the transportation industry as a whole.
  </p>

  <p>
    I recently earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering in December 2025.
    While my formal education provided strong theoretical foundations, I have learned
    just as much through hands-on mechanical and electrical projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website exists to document those projects and the lessons behind them.
    I am deeply grateful to everyone who made these experiences possible —
    and to any engineers, technicians, or recruiters who take the time to explore my work.
  </p>
