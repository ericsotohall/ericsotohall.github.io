  <h1>1995 Honda XR600 – Frame-Up Restoration</h1>

  <p>
    Complete frame-up restoration of a 1995 Honda XR600 dual-sport motorcycle.
    Project involved full teardown to the bare frame, mechanical refurbishment,
    suspension overhaul, and a ground-up electrical rebuild.
    The factory wiring harness was removed and replaced with a custom-built harness,
    including new routing, terminations, grounding strategy, and component integration.
    Emphasis was placed on reliability, serviceability, and correct electrical practices
    suitable for off-road vibration and environmental exposure.
