  <p>
    P-Square began as a joke between friends but evolved into a serious prototype project.
    It applies undergraduate electrical engineering concepts to a sanitation-focused product.
  </p>

  <p>
    The idea is simple: gamify urinal accuracy. The device sits inside a urinal and measures
    stream strength and duration using extremely low-power circuitry. It generates a four-digit score
    displayed on a 7-segment display. After completion, a short code can be entered later to upload
    scores to a leaderboard — maintaining privacy while encouraging engagement.
  </p>

  <p>
    The system emphasizes low power design, sensor signal processing, and user interaction
    without requiring touch until after restroom exit. Prototypes are currently in development.
